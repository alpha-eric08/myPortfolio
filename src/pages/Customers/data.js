I spent the weekend searching for a plugin that was visually slick and that offered the flexibility I needed, namely the ability to link to any URL and not just back to a post. Support confirmed that it had the feature I needed so I went ahead and purchased a license. I was up and running in under an hour. Visually this is one of the best out there with tons of options. It has an intuitive admin panel. And it works the way I need it to. Good job!"
